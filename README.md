# Movimento
A simple software to compute friction force.

Introduction
------------
Movimento is a tool to compute maximum friction force. This also implements arithmetic mean and standard error (unbiased estimation) calculations for a set of data.

Movimento was built to communicate with a specific hardware developed on the Arduino platform to measure maximum friction force.

Hardware specifications are not available yet, however, the driver deployed for Arduino is available and can be used in other projects.
